                    <h2> CAREER OVERVIEW</h2>
                    <p>Fidel Castro, a Cuban revolutionary, led the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, establishing
                        a
                        socialist
                        state. As Prime Minister and later President, he implemented sweeping reforms, nationalizing
                        industries and
                        redistributing land. Despite controversy and criticism, Castro remained a prominent global
                        figure
                        until his
                        retirement in 2008</p>

                    <li>Castro maintained a close relationship with the Cuban military, which played a significant role

                    <br>
                    <li>Given Castro's focus on socialist economic policies, economic advisors would play a crucial role

                    <li>This would include administrative assistants, secretaries, security personnel, and other support
